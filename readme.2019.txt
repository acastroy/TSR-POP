My assembler code for the DOS trainers I released with TMB Productions. A trainer in this sense is a program that you can use to cheat in a game.

The provided code was used in my trainer releases to enable an ingame menu when pressing a hot key. My trainer would then pop up, provide a menu for changing number of lives, etc., and when done you could resume the game. This was quite impressive during DOS, since back then you didn't have multitasking in the OS.
