 Perfect Interrupt with Screen Buffering v1.0


 This little TSR program was made to show how old Ingame menu driven trainers
were made. Both TWiN and Widget allowed gamers to pop up a menu while playing
which seemed impossible. I decided to figure out their technique so I could
make trainers with ingame menus.

This code is based loosely on both TWiN & WiDGET's late trainers when they
both were members of TRSI. The TSR technique which is only used for popping
was made by Draeden/VLA and can be found in the zip file: TSR_VLA.ZIP



Enjoy,
